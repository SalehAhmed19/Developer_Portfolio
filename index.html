                You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains. But nobody pays me a dime for that
                work.
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop until I become the Web
                Development
                Hero.

                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called

                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
